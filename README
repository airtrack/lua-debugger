A simply command line lua debugger.

This debugger is commonly used in C/C++ project with lua,
add debugger.lua file to the project's lua script directory,
and load it. Then you can use debugger.addfuncbreak to add a
function break point or debugger.addlinebreak to add line break point.
This debugger uses command-line interacting with you, so your project
should enable standard io. when breaking a point, you can do some
operations, which is familiar with gdb, and you can type 'h' for help.
